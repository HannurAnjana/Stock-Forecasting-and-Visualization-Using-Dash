# STOCKS-FORECASTING-AND-VISUALIZATION-USING-DASH
BY TRIBE-L 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple dash app which produces dynamic plots of the closing prices and exponential moving average of user input stock code. In addition to that, We have used a machine learning model (SVR) to give prediction of the closing stock price for n number of user input days.


--> app.py contains web layout and server function. We will be referring to it as our main file.

-->model.py is where we will implement a machine learning model for forecasting the stock price.

-->style.css is the css file for styling the web app.

-->requirements.txt is correct versions of the required Python packages to run the Python code.
